                <!-- I ran out of time to figure this out completely, but here's what I was working on. I couldn't get my 
                text to wrap around the photo at bigger sizes, so I ended up placing all of the <p> in divs in an attempt
                to make a series of responsive boxes that would fit the larger box responsively. The problem I got stuck at
                was that while I could force the width to fit using a percentage, the height wouldn't change so only the
                first <p> actually sits by the photo. Also I realize this is a problem for the lower <p>s in that they won't
                fit the entire box's width if they're forced to be 80%. Anyway. There it is. -->
